## Introduction

Fragments are a fundamental part of Android development. They allow you to create modular sections of your appâ€™s UI and handle interactions within these sections. This project explores various aspects of fragments, such as fragment-to-fragment communication, handling lifecycle events, and managing interactions with user interface elements.

## Features

- **Fragment Communication:** Learn how to communicate between fragments using different approaches.
- **HMI Interactions:** Understand how fragments interact with user interface elements and manage user input.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Explore fragment lifecycle and how to handle lifecycle events.
- **Dynamic Fragment Transactions:** Implement dynamic fragment transactions for adding, replacing, and removing fragments.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 4.0 or higher
- Android SDK 30 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Java or Kotlin

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/satya170790/FragmentDemo.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Android Studio:**

   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select `Open an existing project`.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open it.

3. **Build and Run:**

   - Select the device or emulator you want to run the app on.
   - Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut `Shift + F10`.

## Usage

- **Explore Fragment Communication:** Check the `FragmentCommunication` example to see how fragments can communicate with each other using `Bundle`, `ViewModel`, or `Interface`.
- **Explore HMI Interactions:** Review `HMIInteractions` to understand how fragments interact with UI components and handle user input.


## Project Structure

- **`/src/main/java/`**: Contains all the Java/Kotlin code.
- **`/src/main/res/layout/`**: Contains XML layout files for the fragments and activities.
- **`/src/main/res/values/`**: Contains string resources and styles.
- **`/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**: Declares application components.
